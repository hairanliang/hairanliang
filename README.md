### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Hairan
#### I love using data to create models that make our lives better, or even just more fun. 

I'm an incoming Master's student at Columbia University studying Computer Science. I did my undergrad at UCLA, where I got to explore data science and machine learning through my involvement in the [Buonomano Lab](https://www.buonomanolab.com/), [Chiang Lab]https://www.uclahealth.org/departments/neurosurgery/research/research-scientists/jeffrey-chiang-phd), and [Data Science Union](https://datascienceunion.com/)â€”â€”some of the members are pictured below :)
